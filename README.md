This is my capstone project for the Python 4 Everyone course from Coursera

## Week 1 ./pagerank/
Page Ranking Scripts

BeautifulSoup4 is assumed to be installed on the computer and is not included in this repository.

### To run the page ranking scripts, run in the following order
#### 1 - spider.py (spider the website given)
#### 2 - spdump.py (dump contents of spider.sqlite to screen)
#### 3 - sprank.py (ranks the pages based on links to/from)
#### 4 - spjson.py (create the visualization needed for force.html)
#### 5 - open force.html

### Deliverables
